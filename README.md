## Resources
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for in-depth learning and documentation.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for quick references and examples. If you don't know what something is, Google it and find the W3schools link about it. They usually break things down really well.
- [ChatGPT](https://www.chat.openai.com) for custom help. Ask this chat bot anything you want. (e.g. 'what is an HTML `<h1>` tag?') And then ask follow up questions to customize it to your understanding (e.g. 'can you say that in a more simple way?')

## Need help?
- Do your best to research on your own first. Research and Googling are some of the most important aspects of coding. Ask questions on ChatGPT, look up answers on Stack Overflow or other online communities.
- But if you get stuck, don't be to prideful to ask for help! Text me, call me, or ask me in person. I want to help you learn and have fun while you're at it.
