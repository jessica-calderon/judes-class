# Introduction to HTML

## Overview
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

HTML is basically the basis of most websites. Think of it as the wood structure in new house being built.

## What You'll Learn
- Basic understanding of HTML.
- Creating a simple HTML webpage.
- Using Replit to build and preview your webpage.

## Getting Started with Replit
1. Visit [Replit](https://replit.com/) and create a free account.
2. Once logged in, click on the "+ New Repl" button.
3. Choose "HTML, CSS, JS" as the language.
4. Name your project (e.g., `FavoriteBandPage`).

## Activity 1: Create a Basic HTML Webpage
Your task is to create a basic HTML page about your favorite band.

### Requirements:
- Include a title for the webpage using the `<title>` tag. The `<title>` tag defines the title of the HTML document and is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- Use at least one `<h1>` tag for the main heading.
- Add a few paragraphs `<p>` about the band.
- Incorporate at least one image with the `<img>` tag (e.g., a band logo).
- Add links `<a>` to external resources (e.g., the band's official website).

### Steps:
1. In your Replit project, open the `index.html` file.
2. Start by defining the `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>` tags.
3. Inside the `<html>` tag, add `<head>` and `<body>` sections.
4. In the `<head>` section, add a `<title>` tag with the name of your band. This title appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
5. In the `<body>` section, use headings, paragraphs, images, and links to build your page.
6. Use the "Run" button to preview your page as you work.

## About HTML Boilerplates
A boilerplate is a set of pre-written code that you can use to start your project. While you can find HTML boilerplates online, it's recommended to build your own for this project to better understand the structure of an HTML document. However, for future projects, feel free to explore and use boilerplates as they can save time and ensure best practices.

## Tips:
- Experiment with different tags and see how they change the webpage.
- Check your page in the preview often to see your changes.

## Submission:
Once completed, share your Replit project link with me for review. I'll check it out, give you my feedback and go over it with you.
